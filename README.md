In Bhatkhande's system, the basic mode of reference is that which is equivalent to the Western Ionian mode or major scale (called Bilawal in Hindustani music). As a part of doing this problem, first you need to read and gain more understanding on this topic.
(a). Use a suitable character set (i.e., a set of symbols), which can be Latin, Sinhala or Tamil characters, to encode and uniquely identify the ten basic thats shown below. Show all thats with the sequences of characters that you selected.
(b). Based on what you obtain in (a) above, construct a DFA to accept all ten basic thats. Show the transition diagram of your DFA. You are expected to clearly indicate or explain how it works.
